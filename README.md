# Type Error in TypeScript function argument
This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a type error. The program defines a function that takes a string argument and returns a string. However, the program attempts to pass an array of strings to the function, which causes a type error. The solution to this problem is to either pass a single string to the function or modify the function to accept an array of strings.
